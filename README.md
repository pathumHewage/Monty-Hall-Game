# Monty-Hall-Game

The Monty Hall Game is a probability puzzle based on a TV game show scenario. In this game, a player is presented with three doors. Behind one door is a prize (e.g., a car), and behind the other two doors are goats. The player selects one door, then the host, Monty Hall, who knows what's behind each door, opens one of the other two doors, revealing a goat. The player is then given the option to stick with their original choice or switch to the other unopened door. The puzzle explores the probability of winning the prize by switching versus sticking with the initial choice.

## How It Works

1. The player selects one of the three doors.
2. Monty Hall opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing a goat.
3. The player decides whether to stick with their original choice or switch to the other unopened door.
4. The door is opened to reveal if the player has won the prize or not.
